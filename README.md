The [`cvmatrix`](https://pypi.org/project/cvmatrix/) package implements the fast cross-validation algorithms by Engstrøm and Jensen [[1]](#references) for computation of training set $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{Y}$ in a cross-validation setting. In addition to correctly handling arbitrary row-wise pre-processing, the algorithms allow for and efficiently and correctly handle any combination of column-wise centering and scaling of `X` and `Y` based on training set statistical moments.

For an implementation of the fast cross-validation algorithms combined with Improved Kernel Partial Least Squares [[2]](#references), see the Python package [`ikpls`](https://pypi.org/project/ikpls/) by Engstrøm et al. [[3]](#references).

## NEW IN 2.0.0: Weighted CVMatrix
The `cvmatrix` software package now also features **weigthed matrix produts** $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{Y}$ **without increasing time or space complexity compared to the unweighted case**. This is due to a generalization of the algorithms by Engstrøm and Jensen [[1]](#references). A new article formally describing the generalization is to be announced.

## Installation

- Install the package for Python3 using the following command:
    ```shell
    pip3 install cvmatrix
    ```

- Now you can import the class implementing all the algorithms with:
    ```python
    from cvmatrix.cvmatrix import CVMatrix
    ```

## Quick Start

### Use the cvmatrix package for fast computation of training set kernel matrices

> ```python
> import numpy as np
> from cvmatrix.cvmatrix import CVMatrix
>
> N = 100  # Number of samples.
> K = 50  # Number of features.
> M = 10  # Number of targets.
>
> X = np.random.uniform(size=(N, K)) # Random X data
> Y = np.random.uniform(size=(N, M)) # Random Y data
> folds = np.arange(100) % 5 # 5-fold cross-validation
>
> # Weights must be non-negative and the sum of weights for any training partition must
> # be greater than zero.
> weights = np.random.uniform(size=(N,)) + 0.1
>
> # Instantiate CVMatrix
> cvm = CVMatrix(
>     folds=folds,
>     center_X=True, # Cemter around the weighted mean of X.
>     center_Y=True, # Cemter around the weighted mean of Y.
>     scale_X=True, # Scale by the weighted standard deviation of X.
>     scale_Y=True, # Scale by the weighted standard deviation of Y.
> )
> # Fit on X and Y
> cvm.fit(X=X, Y=Y, weights=weights)
> # Compute training set XTWX and/or XTWY for each fold
> for fold in cvm.folds_dict.keys():
>     # Get both XTWX and XTWY
>     training_XTX, training_XTY = cvm.training_XTX_XTY(fold)
>     # Get only XTWX
>     training_XTX = cvm.training_XTX(fold)
>     # Get only XTWY
>     training_XTY = cvm.training_XTY(fold)

## Benchmarks

In [benchmarks](https://github.com/Sm00thix/CVMatrix/tree/main/benchmarks), we have benchmarked cross-validation of the fast algorithms in [`cvmatrix`](https://pypi.org/project/cvmatrix/) against the baseline algorithms implemented in [NaiveCVMatrix](https://github.com/Sm00thix/CVMatrix/tree/main/tests/naive_cvmatrix.py).

   <em> <strong>Left:</strong> Benchmarking cross-validation with the CVMatrix implementation versus the baseline implementation using three common combinations of (column-wise) centering and scaling. <strong>Right:</strong> Benchmarking cross-validation with the CVMatrix implementation for all possible combinations of (column-wise) centering and scaling. Here, most of the graphs lie on top of eachother. In general, no preprocessing is faster than centering which, in turn, is faster than scaling. </em>
